[Program 5]
[Description]
There are 3 java files: PasswordCrack.java, User.java, and jcrypt.java. We decided to create a User object that holds all necessary information about a user such as username, first/last name, hash, and seed. The constructor for this object takes in a line of text from the password file and uses the split function to extract the data. We felt it was easiest to keep the track of all dictionary words (and subsequent mangled versions) in an ArrayList as well as keep an ArrayList of Users for iteration. We split up the string manipulations in three levels: 1 being the most trivial, and so forth. To run our program, you need to use "java PasswordCrack dictionary passwords‚Äù.
